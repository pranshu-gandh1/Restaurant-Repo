Extensions Used In My Code:
In-App Purchases - As discussed with the teacher, we got as far as we could but due to lack of time couldn’t implement it into the code.
Animations In Flutter extension - Used implicit animations called “AnimatedOpacity” to fade menu items when they are not in the cart and “AnimatedSize” to resize the “IconButton” when an item is added.
